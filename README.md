This is an R package for Non-Parametric Empirical Bayes estimation in the Discrete Linear Exponential (`DLE`) family, which includes a wide class of discrete distributions frequently arising from modern big data applications. The proposed framework directly estimates the Bayes shrinkage factor in the generalized Robbins' formula via solving a scalable convex
program, which is carefully developed based on a RKHS representation of the Stein's discrepancy
measure. Moreover, the new estimation framework is flexible for incorporating various structural constraints into the data driven rule, and provides a unified approach to compound estimation with both regular and scaled squared error losses.
